This is a responsive landing page built to showcase key front-end development skills. The primary feature is an interactive navigation menu that changes its style based on user interaction.

Features
Fixed Navigation Menu: The menu stays at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down the page, providing constant access to different sections.

Scroll-Activated Styles: The navigation bar's background and link colors change dynamically when the user scrolls down the page, indicating an active state.

Hover Effects: Menu items have a hover effect, giving clear visual feedback when a user interacts with them.

Clean & Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktops and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the semantic structure for the page, including the header, main content sections, and footer.

CSS: Used for styling, creating the layout, and managing the visual transitions for the fixed and scrolled states of the navigation bar.

JavaScript: Adds the core interactivity by listening for scroll and hover events to apply or remove CSS classes.
